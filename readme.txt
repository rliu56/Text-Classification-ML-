	Unzip the dataset files and run commands (see the makefile).

All the three different models in this project ignore punctuation and special characters as well as normalize words by converting them to lower case and converting plural words to singular.
1. multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm with add-one Laplace smoothing;
2. MAP(Maximum-a-Posteriori Estimation) Logistic Regression algorithm with L2 regularization;
3. Perceptron algorithm.
